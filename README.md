Chosen One Condition Report™ — Demo Hub

by Webmaster Eric

The Chosen One Condition Report™ is a present-moment awareness system delivered live on TikTok.

It provides clarity by reflecting:
	•	current operating conditions
	•	behavioral and relational patterns
	•	how a person responds to pressure, interruption, and opportunity

It is not prediction, diagnosis, or professional advice.

This repository exists to demonstrate the system and route viewers to the live experience.

What This Repo Is

This is the public demo hub served via GitHub Pages.

It contains:
	•	a single hub landing page
	•	supporting static pages that show ability to contextualize the my seo prowess


There are:
	•	no generators
	•	no templates
	•	no automation logic

The system itself runs live elsewhere.

Live Demo (Source of Truth)

The official demo of the Chosen One Condition Report™ lives here:

Demo:
https://webmastereric.github.io/chosen-one-condition-report/

This repository does not reimplement the demo.
It points to it, explains it, and frames how it is used.

⸻

Delivery Model (Fixed)

The report operates on a strict cadence:
	•	Morning Report — next 8 hours
	•	Midday Report — following 8 hours
	•	Night Report — final 8 hours

Maximum: 3 reports per day

This limit is intentional.
It preserves signal quality and prevents dependency.
