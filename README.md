# Digital Marketing King — by Webmaster Eric

**Webmaster Eric** is an **SEO & Conversion Systems Consultant**.

**Promise:** Owned search results that convert.  
**One-liner:** I build owned search results that turn free organic traffic into paid leads.

## What this repo is
This is the **public money site** (GitHub Pages).  
It contains:
- A single **Hub** landing page (`/index.html`)
- Supporting **Spoke** pages (`/spokes/<slug>/index.html`)

This repo contains **output only** (HTML pages).  
No generators. No templates. No automation logic.

## Primary CTA
Work begins by subscribing on TikTok:
- https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPHEYu6AMBKm3-MGuav/

## Structure
- `/index.html` — Hub (conversion + authority destination)
- `/spokes/` — Spokes (buyer-intent pages that route back to the hub)
- `/sitemap.xml` — Indexing support
- `/robots.txt` — Crawl rules

## Note
The private engine that generates spokes and updates “Latest 3” is kept in a **separate private repo**.
